# Sentiment Analysis of WhatsApp Chats

## Project Description

This project performs sentiment and emotion analysis on WhatsApp chat data, particularly focusing on Hinglish (Hindi words written using the English alphabet). The analysis includes mapping the sentiment and emotions over time, visualizing the results, and providing summary statistics. The goal is to understand the emotional dynamics and overall tone of the conversation.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Detects and visualizes the sentiment scores in the chat messages over 15-minute intervals.
- **Emotion Detection:** Identifies and visualizes various emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger) over 15-minute intervals.
- **Hinglish Handling:** Translates Hinglish words to English for accurate sentiment analysis.
- **Summary Statistics:** Provides mean and standard deviation for sentiment and emotion scores.
